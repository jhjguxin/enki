= Lesstile

Converts text formatted with an exceedingly simple markup language into valid HTML (iron clad guarantee!) - perfect for comments on your blog. Textile isn't good for this because not only does it do too much (do commenters really need subscript?), but it can also output invalid HTML (try a <b> tag over multiple lines...). Whitelisting HTML is another option, but you still need some sort of parsing if you want syntax highlighting.

Integrates with CodeRay for sexy syntax highlighting.

== Synopsis

  comment = <<-EOS
  "Ego Link":http://rhnh.net
  Wow, this post is awesome. I'd implement it like this:

  --- Ruby
  def hello_world
    puts "hello world!"
  end
  ---

  --- HTML
  <strong>Look, HTML code</strong>
  ---

  ---
  just some normal code
  ---
  EOS

  Lesstile.format_as_html(comment)
  Lesstile.format_as_html(comment, :code_formatter => Lesstile::CodeRayFormatter) # Requires coderay
  Lesstile.format_as_html(comment, :code_formatter => lambda {|code, lang| "Code in #{lang}: #{code}" })

  # Also XHTML, for the old schoolers
  Lesstile.format_as_xhtml(comment)
